    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We totaly train 6 model of this assignment, and you can find that in OneDrive link, there is a folder call \"myexp\", you should firstly download \"myexp\" folder from OneDrive and replace the empty myexp folder in \"code\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are 7 yaml file in \"code\" folder, files other than \"config_mattinghuman_test_on_eg1800.yaml\" are models trained and tested on the corresponding datase. \"config_mattinghuman_test_on_eg1800.yaml\" means that train on mattinghuman, test on eg1800. If you want to do more experience like that, you can follow the format show in \"config_mattinghuman_test_on_eg1800.yaml\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Description of individual files/folders\n",
    "\n",
    "    train.py: Main training program with some hyperparameter settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    portraitnet.py: Network structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    utils.py: Loss functions and diaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    dataset.py: Dataset construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    data_aug.py: Enhanced components of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    test.py: runs a test on the test set and calculates mIOU.\n",
    "\n",
    "    test_for_single.ipynb: Test the model with a single image and visualize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Build_dataset.py: For our own dataset (one that has never been trained on the model), we need to first run this file to construct the dataset.txt file. (It only needs to be run the first time a new dataset is available, and you may need to change the internal data construction logic yourself.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    /data: The folder that holds the training set and test set paths.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "    /myexp: Stores checkpoints and training journals for training models (tensorboard). Please go to OneDrive to download and replace this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    /plot_result: Store the results of the different model visualizations as shown in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Start training: 1). Set the path to the yaml file in the train.py file (lines 436--475). 2).Change data\\_root: (the upper level of the root directory of the target dataset), file\\_root: (the root directory of the .txt file that stores the label/path of the dataset), model\\_root(the path that stores the experimental diary and the optimal model) in the corresponding .yaml file. 3).Run the train.py file to start the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Wish to start training on your own dataset: 1). Use Build\\_dataset.py file to build the corresponding .txt path index file of the dataset (different datasets need to adjust the code structure a little bit). 2). Create a new .yaml file, fill in the above addresses into the data\\_root, file\\_root, model\\_root, change the datasetlist for the name of their own dataset. 3). in dataset.py file in the myDataSet class in the new class of data reading methods. 4). in dataset.py file in the PortraitSeg class to add new pictures and labels in the logic of the read-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To test the complete test set and get the mIOU score: 1). Set the config\\_path variable in the test.py file (lines 63--93) 2). Run the test.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Visualize the model single image effect: 1). change the config\\_path variable in test\\_for\\_single.ipynb. 2). set the address of the image to be tested in the img\\_ori variable. 3. run all the code in .ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Note: 1). When you need to train and test the EasyPortrait\\_eyes model, please make the variable n\\_class = 3 in the function portraitnet.MobileNetV2( ) in the files train.py and test.py and test\\_for\\_single.ipynb, and keep the variable n\\_class = 3 when you train the model with other datasets. Otherwise, keep n\\_class = 2. At the same time, you also need to change the labeling code of dataset.py (lines 201--217), the labeling treatment is not the same when training TEETH and when training EYES. 2). If you want to start training again after interrupting training, change the resume variable (line 472) in the train.py file to True."
